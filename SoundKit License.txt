SoundKit License 
Let’s all be adults here. We want you to get the most out of the SoundKit royalty free sound effects library. So if we can all just follow a few simple rules, we can make the world a better place, or at least make it sound better. By purchasing the SoundKit library, you need to agree to a few ground rules.


WHAT YOU CAN DO:
Use sounds for personal and commercial projects
Use sounds for multiple projects
Use sounds for yourself or on behalf of a client
Upload/Embed sounds into project files and code accessible by others
Alter sounds as you see fit for your projects

WHAT YOU CAN’T DO
Resell, sublicense, repackage, or distribute sounds on their own
Give the sounds to your buddies when no one is looking
Leap tall buildings in a  single bound


See, that was pretty easy. If you have any questions about use, or if you’d like to purchase a multiuser/enterprise license, please contact us directly at beepboop@soundkit.io
